## Abstract

![](images/Model_Desc1.png?raw=true)


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, resulting in gradual memory loss, with aging being a key contributing factor. Biological age, which reflects an individual’s physiological function level, can be estimated using -omics markers. It is hypothesized that AD patients may display signs of accelerated aging, leading to a notable gap between their chronological and biological ages. In this study, we aim is to develop a blood-based Metabo-Age to assess metabolic changes associated with normal aging and to investigate the potential of Metabo-Age delta (the difference between biological and chronological ages) as an indicator of accelerated metabolic aging caused by AD pathology and neurodegeneration. We identified a cluster of metabolic parameters linked to aging, with variations observed between males and females. Notably, metabolite levels in females showed stronger associations with aging. Furthermore, we found a significant association between the Metabo-Age delta and longitudinal changes in memory and brain structure, highlighting its potential for monitoring disease progression or treatment response in neurological disorders.
